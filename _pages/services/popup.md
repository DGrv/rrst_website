## LED Display Appearance in Photos and Videos

Our LED finish arch panels operate at a **60 Hz frame rate** and a **3840 Hz refresh rate**.
This specification is considered a high-quality standard for professional event LED systems and ensures stable, flicker-free performance to the human eye under normal viewing conditions.

However, when photographed or filmed, horizontal bands or wave-like patterns may occasionally appear. These effects are not defects of the LED panel. They are caused by technical interactions between:

* The LED screen’s refresh rate (3840 Hz)
* The camera’s shutter speed and frame rate
* The pixel grid of the display and the camera sensor

### Why This Happens

**1. Flicker Banding**
Cameras capture images line by line. If the camera’s shutter speed is not synchronized with the LED refresh cycle, visible light or dark bands may appear in photos or videos. This is a common effect when filming or photographing LED screens of any brand.

**2. Moiré Patterns**
When the pixel grid of the LED panel interacts with the pixel grid of the camera sensor—especially at close distances—wave-like or grid interference patterns can occur. This is a normal optical phenomenon and does not indicate a quality issue.

### How to Minimize the Effect

For professional photography or videography, the effect can typically be reduced or eliminated by:

* Using manual camera settings
* Setting frame rate to **60 fps or 120 fps**
* Using shutter speeds such as **1/60 or 1/120**
* Avoiding extreme close-up shots

Professional photographers covering sporting events are familiar with these adjustments and can easily optimize camera settings accordingly.

### Important Note

Any visible banding or moiré patterns in photos or videos are caused by camera synchronization and optical physics—not by a malfunction or deficiency of the LED display.

Under normal viewing conditions, our 60 Hz / 3840 Hz LED panels operate reliably and meet professional event display standards.
